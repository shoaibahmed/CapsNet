# CapsNet - TensorFlow

Playground for experimentation with CapsNet.

To initiate the training, use the command:
```
python capsnet.py -t -s -c -v --batchSize 500 --trainingEpochs 100 -d MNIST
```
where -t stands for training, -s for training from scratch, -c stands for model testing after training, -v is used for tensorboard output, and -d specifies the dataset to be used. The system supports two datasets at this point (MNIST and CIFAR-10). Keep in mind that enabling the tensorboard visualization will take up much more GPU memory, hence, might require you to reduce the batch size.

For just testing a trained model, use the command:
```
python capsnet.py -c --batchSize 500 -d MNIST
```
where absence of -t flag indicates that only testing of the trained model has to be performed.
